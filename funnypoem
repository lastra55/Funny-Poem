For a while, my pet seemed normal to me
Doing all the things that dogs do
But then he started signaling for turns
And stopping for red lights too.

There came a time when he couldnt poop
No way could I assist him
Until the local mechanic revealed
A clogge emision system.

Then my dog saw the sky
I thought his mind was in a war
Me like Han Solo and my dog as chewe
Together just like starwars.
